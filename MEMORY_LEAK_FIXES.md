# Memory Leak and yt-dlp Installation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Memory Leak Issues

#### Fixed Issues:
✅ **Video Element Cleanup**: Video elements now properly pause, clear src, and reload on unmount
✅ **Blob URL Cleanup**: All created blob URLs are properly revoked when components unmount
✅ **Animation Frame Cleanup**: Fixed requestAnimationFrame cleanup in the timeline animation
✅ **MediaRecorder Stream Cleanup**: All media stream tracks are properly stopped
✅ **Event Listener Cleanup**: Video event listeners are properly removed on unmount

#### New Memory Management Features:
- Added `timeoutRefs` and `animationFrameRefs` for tracking and cleanup
- Created `createManagedTimeout()` and `createManagedAnimationFrame()` helper functions
- Comprehensive cleanup effect that runs on component unmount

### 2. yt-dlp Installation Issues

#### Problem:
The yt-dlp binary was being reset every few days because:
- `yt-dlp-wrap` downloads temporary binaries that get cleared
- No persistent installation management
- No fallback mechanism when downloads fail

#### Solution:
✅ **Persistent Installation Script**: Created `scripts/install-ytdlp.js` that:
- Downloads yt-dlp to a persistent `bin/` directory
- Checks for existing installations and updates if older than 7 days
- Includes self-update functionality
- Provides fallback to default installation if needed

✅ **Package.json Integration**: Added scripts:
- `postinstall`: Automatically installs yt-dlp after npm install
- `install-ytdlp`: Manual installation command

✅ **Code Updates**: Modified `actions.ts` to:
- Use persistent yt-dlp installation from `bin/` directory
- Include fallback to default installation
- Improved error handling

## Usage

### Running the yt-dlp installer:
```bash
npm run install-ytdlp
```

### The installer will:
1. Create a `bin/` directory in your project root
2. Download the latest yt-dlp binary for your platform
3. Make it executable (on Unix systems)
4. Test the installation

### Memory Leak Prevention:
The component now automatically:
- Cleans up all video elements on unmount
- Revokes all blob URLs to prevent memory leaks
- Cancels all active animation frames
- Clears all managed timeouts
- Removes all event listeners

## Files Modified

### Core Component:
- `src/components/short-creator.tsx`: Added comprehensive memory management

### yt-dlp Integration:
- `src/app/actions.ts`: Updated to use persistent yt-dlp installation
- `scripts/install-ytdlp.js`: New installation script
- `package.json`: Added installation scripts
- `.gitignore`: Added bin/ directory to ignore list

## Best Practices Added

### Memory Management:
```tsx
// Use managed timeouts
const timeoutId = createManagedTimeout(() => {
  // Your code here
}, delay);

// Use managed animation frames  
const frameId = createManagedAnimationFrame((time) => {
  // Your animation code here
});
```

### Cleanup Pattern:
```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  // Setup code...
  
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code runs automatically
    // All managed timeouts and frames are cleaned up
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. **Memory Leaks**: 
   - Open Chrome DevTools → Performance
   - Record while using the video editor
   - Check for memory growth patterns

2. **yt-dlp Persistence**:
   - Check `bin/yt-dlp.exe` exists after installation
   - Restart your development server
   - Verify video processing still works

## Maintenance

The yt-dlp binary will auto-update weekly when the application starts. If you need to force an update:
```bash
npm run install-ytdlp
```

## Notes

- The `bin/` directory is gitignored but will be recreated automatically
- All video-related memory leaks should now be resolved
- yt-dlp installation persists across system restarts and deployments
- Fallback mechanisms ensure the application continues working even if the persistent installation fails
